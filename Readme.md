# Nexus IQ

Nexus IQ is a local-first qualitative text measurement platform. It combines a Next.js shell with a Node backend so teams can move from exploratory reading to calibrated, evidence-linked analysis without depending on a hosted service by default.

**Release version:** `v2.3.3`

The product is built around two modes of work:

- Fast exploration: import text, inspect the corpus, generate briefs, draft constructs, and try instruments quickly.
- Honest publication: calibrate against human-coded gold data, inspect the evidence behind each result, and export reproducible artifacts with clear provenance.
- The Next.js shell runs on port `3000`.
- The Nexus IQ backend runs on port `7341` by default.
- The shell proxies `/api/*` requests to the backend automatically.

## Demo Flow

No API keys are required for a full local walkthrough.

1. Create a project.
2. Import `demo/techcorp-exit-survey.csv`.
3. Review the automatic mapping and initial corpus scan.
4. Generate a brief, draft constructs, and compile instruments.
5. Run calibration and analysis using the built-in mock provider.

`MockModel` exists to make the full workflow usable out of the box. It is deterministic, local, and clearly labeled as mock output.

## Model Providers

Nexus IQ supports:

- Anthropic
- OpenAI
- OpenRouter
- Ollama
- MockModel

Keys are stored in `config/keys.json`, which is gitignored and excluded from exports.

## Privacy & PII Handling

Before analysis, Nexus IQ can scan a corpus for emails, phone numbers, SSNs, URL-embedded credentials, and likely names, then reversibly pseudonymize them (`[EMAIL_1]`, `[NAME_2]`, …) with the re-identification map stored outside the project bundle. This covers both unit text and string metadata columns.

Name detection is a capitalized-bigram heuristic with a stoplist, not a trained NER model. It will miss single first names and non-"Firstname Lastname" name orders, and can occasionally mis-flag or miss unlisted proper nouns. Treat it as a strong first pass, not a guarantee — review a sample of masked output before sharing or exporting a corpus that contains real personal data.

## Repository Map

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pages/` | Next.js shell entrypoints |
| `public/app/` | Browser UI assets and vanilla JS application code |
| `server/` | Local backend, routing, analysis engine, reporting, and providers |
| `demo/` | Seeded demo corpus and oracle data |
| `tests/` | Unit, integration, server, simulation, and end-to-end coverage |
| `tools/` | Helper scripts for repo maintenance |

## Quick Start

Requires Node.js `>=20.10` and npm.

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. The shell starts the backend alongside it; the backend remains loopback-only on port `7341` by default.

Other commands:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
npm test
```

Useful targeted checks:

```bash
node --test tests/e2e/pipeline.test.js
node --test tests/e2e/perf.test.js
node --test tests/sim/dsl.sim.test.js
```

## Changelog

### v2.3.3

- Security: refuse cross-origin state changes — an `Origin` guard on every mutating request (CSRF), with the opt-in shared coder listener relaxed to match its intended LAN exposure.

### v2.3.2

- Filesystem hardening: validate project slugs at the store boundary with resolved-path containment, write bundles/keys/PII vaults with private `0700`/`0600` modes (plus a boot-time chmod migration), and sweep abandoned pending imports at startup.

### v2.3.1

- Providers: omit sampling params for models that reject them (with a one-shot 400 retry), corrected Claude Opus 4.8 metadata ($5/$25, 1M context) and the OpenAI fallback catalog (`gpt-5-mini`, GPT-5.2 $1.75/$14); strict privacy now refuses non-loopback Ollama endpoints.

### v2.3.0

- Release prep: bumped to `v2.3.0`, removed the unused `lint` devDependency (empty `devDependencies`), and refreshed the README quick-start.

## Notes

- The app is designed to run locally on macOS or Windows with the same basic workflow.
- Project bundles are file-based and portable, optimized for practical local use rather than large-scale hosted deployment.
- Replication exports include machine-readable artifacts plus generated R and Python helpers for external verification.
